# Clinical Evaluation Report

**Demographic Information**

- **Name:** Child Baby Love
- **Date of Birth:** 5/11/2023
- **Chronological Age:** 23 Months
- **Sex:** Male
- **Primary Language:** Spanish
- **Parent/Guardian:** Child's Mother
- **Service Coordinator:** Karen Zamoran
- **Examiner:** Fushia Crooms, MOT, OTR/L
- **Date of Report:** 5/28/2025
- **Date of Encounter:** 5/5/2025

**Reason for Referral and Background Information**

Child was referred for a feeding and swallowing evaluation due to difficulty chewing food and frequent vomiting after meals. He was delivered at full term via vaginal delivery, weighing 8 pounds, and did not require NICU care. His medical history includes three hospitalizations due to fluid in the lungs, but he is otherwise in good health with up-to-date immunizations and no known allergies. He currently receives speech therapy once a week and occupational therapy twice a week to support fine motor development. His mother reports challenges with overstuffing his mouth during meals, inconsistent chewing, and a preference for using utensils. No dental concerns have been reported, although he is resistant to toothbrushing.

**Test Observations**

During the feeding evaluation, Child was cooperative and engaged, maintaining an upright posture in a highchair. He participated with interest and accepted assistance when needed. He demonstrated a tendency to overstuff his mouth and gagged several times due to large food amounts. Verbal and visual cues were provided, and he responded positively to caregiver involvement.

**Assessment Tools**

- Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development - Fourth Edition (BSID-4)
- Toddler Sensory Profile 2 (SP2)
- Child Oral and Motor Proficiency Scale (ChOMPS)
- Pediatric Eating Assessment Tool (PediEAT)

**Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development - Fourth Edition (BSID-4)**

- **Cognitive Scale:** Child completed problem-solving tasks with emerging accuracy. He demonstrated basic visual-spatial reasoning but limited relational play and attention to books. His cognitive scaled score is 2, indicating an age equivalent of 18 months, placing him in the extremely low range.

- **Receptive Communication:** Child reacts to sounds and simple verbal requests but inconsistently responds to his name. His receptive communication scaled score is 1, with an age equivalent of 10 months, in the extremely low range.

- **Expressive Communication:** Child initiates play and uses gestures but has limited expressive vocabulary. His expressive communication scaled score is 1, with an age equivalent of 10 months, in the extremely low range.

- **Fine Motor:** Child shows emerging foundational skills but significant delays in bilateral coordination and motor planning. His fine motor scaled score is 4, with an age equivalent of 17 months, indicating a 41% delay.

- **Gross Motor:** Child is ambulatory with functional mobility but requires assistance for stairs. His gross motor scaled score is 5, with an age equivalent of 19 months, in the low average range.

- **Social-Emotional:** Child engages in pretend play and communicates likes and dislikes. His social-emotional scaled score is 6, in the low average range.

- **Adaptive Behavior:** Child's adaptive functioning is in the very low range, with delays across all subdomains. His overall Adaptive Behavior Composite score is 72.

**Toddler Sensory Profile 2 (SP2)**

Child exhibits decreased sensory seeking and heightened sensitivity, particularly to tactile input and routine changes. He shows reduced interest in sensory exploration and high sensory avoidance, affecting daily routines and play.

**Child Oral and Motor Proficiency Scale (ChOMPS)**

Child presents concerns in all domains, including complex movement patterns and oral-motor coordination. He uses compensatory strategies like finger-feeding due to limited oral control.

**Pediatric Eating Assessment Tool (PediEAT)**

Child's total score indicates concerns in physiologic symptoms, oral processing, and selective eating. He experiences vomiting, prolonged oral retention, and prefers predictable textures.

**Physical Examination**

- **Body:** Adequate postural alignment, with slight leaning observed.
- **Head & Neck:** Functional head control with occasional avoidance behavior.
- **Face:** Symmetrical features with limited expression variability.
- **Jaw:** Adequate opening but limited lateral movement and rotary chew.
- **Lips:** Partially open with insufficient seal.
- **Tongue:** Limited movement, relying on fingers for repositioning.
- **Cheeks:** Reduced strength with food pocketing.
- **Palate:** Structurally intact with functional elevation.

**Cranial Nerve Screening**

- **CN I (Olfactory):** Not formally assessed.
- **CN V (Trigeminal):** Reduced jaw control and chewing strength.
- **CN VII (Facial):** Reduced lip closure and cheek engagement.
- **CN IX (Glossopharyngeal):** Mild gag response with certain textures.
- **CN X (Vagus):** Clear vocal quality with brief coughing during feeding.
- **CN XI (Accessory):** Appropriate head positioning.
- **CN XII (Hypoglossal):** Limited tongue movements and bolus manipulation.

**Summary**

Child presents with feeding difficulties due to oral-motor delay, sensory challenges, and limited motor planning. He demonstrates immature chewing, overstuffing, and inconsistent lip closure. His sensory profile indicates tactile defensiveness and oral under-responsiveness. Standardized assessments support a high level of concern for oral-motor dysfunction and sensory integration difficulties.

**Recommendations**

- **Feeding therapy:** Once a week to address oral-motor skill development and sensory exploration via textures.

**Goals**

1. Reduce finger use during mealtime by using tongue-based strategies in 4/5 opportunities with minimal prompts.
2. Demonstrate closed-mouth rotary chewing without sucking behavior in 3/5 observed bites.
3. Clear the oral cavity without pocketing in 4/5 trials following oral motor cueing.
4. Participate in 5 minutes of oral sensory prep prior to feeding with active engagement in at least 3 strategies.

The final determination for services will be made by the Regional Center Eligibility Team after reviewing this report.
