**Clinical Observations:**

During the session, Child Baby Love frequently placed his fingers in his mouth, which may indicate a sensory-seeking behavior or a self-soothing mechanism. He demonstrated a tendency to overstuff his mouth multiple times, leading to instances of gagging. This behavior suggests challenges with oral-motor control and awareness. Child Baby Love utilized both hands to self-feed, which indicates a level of independence; however, he also accepted assistance, suggesting a need for support in managing food effectively.

**Assessment Score Interpretations:**

**Bayley-4:**

Child Baby Love's cognitive scaled score of 2, corresponding to an age equivalent of 18 months, falls within the "Extremely Low" range, indicating significant developmental delays in cognitive processing compared to peers. His language score of 1, with an age equivalent of 10 months, also reflects an "Extremely Low" classification, suggesting substantial delays in expressive and receptive language skills. The motor score of 4, equating to an age equivalent of 17 months and a percentile rank of 41%, indicates below-average motor skills, impacting his ability to navigate his environment effectively.

**SP2 (Sensory Profile 2):**

Child Baby Love exhibits sensory-seeking behaviors less frequently than peers, while his avoiding and sensitivity scores are much higher than typical. These tendencies may manifest as withdrawal from overstimulating environments or discomfort with certain textures during play and feeding. His typical registration score suggests that he can process sensory information at an average level when stimuli are not overwhelming. These patterns can affect his participation in daily activities, such as play and grooming, potentially leading to avoidance or distress.

**CHOMPS:**

The high concern in all oral-motor domains indicates significant challenges with feeding safety and efficiency. Child Baby Love demonstrates poor bolus control, which can lead to food hoarding and an increased gag reflex, posing risks during meals. These concerns necessitate close monitoring and intervention to ensure safe swallowing and improve his oral-motor skills.

**PEDI-EAT:**

Concerns in physiologic symptoms, oral processing, and selective eating suggest difficulties with feeding safety and endurance. Child Baby Love may exhibit fatigue during meals and a limited diet due to selectivity, requiring caregiver support to encourage a balanced intake. Although no concerns were noted in mealtime behaviors, the existing issues may still impact his overall nutritional status and growth.

---

**Summary & Recommendations:**

Child Baby Love presents with significant developmental delays across cognitive, language, and motor domains, compounded by sensory processing challenges and oral-motor concerns. These issues impact his daily functioning and require targeted intervention.

**Measurable Goals:**

1. Improve oral-motor control to reduce instances of gagging and overstuffing by 50% within 6 months.
2. Enhance cognitive engagement during structured play activities to achieve a cognitive age equivalent of 24 months within 12 months.
3. Increase tolerance to a variety of food textures to expand dietary intake by 25% within 6 months.

**Recommendations:**

1. Initiate a structured oral-motor therapy program focusing on safe swallowing techniques and bolus control.
2. Implement a sensory diet to address sensory processing needs, incorporating calming and organizing activities into daily routines.
3. Encourage caregiver participation in feeding therapy sessions to support skill generalization and provide strategies for managing selective eating at home.
